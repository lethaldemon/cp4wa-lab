To allow you to see the results in this lab, we have replicated a selected data stream from another system and feed it to the CP4WA-Metric Manager data mediation process. The date range of the data feed is from `the 1st of April 2021 00:00 AM` to `the 25th of April 2:55 PM`. The data is coming in 5 minutes intervals. CP4WA-Metric Manager processed the data, as they come, near real-time. Therefore, the lab simulates what the user will see on __the 25th of April 2021 at 3:00 PM__.\n\n  The data comes from a performance manager in a data center. Data includes application and infrastructure performance data.\n  The data comes every 5 minutes. Metric Manager processed related data in a topic. A [reference](./ref/) section had been included to explain the term used. In this lab, the topic is **THINK21**.\n\n  Metric Manager generates an event when it detects abnormal behavior that might indicate a potential problem.\n\n  A typical use of Metric Manager is to observe and act on the generated events. These events can be pushed to the rest of Watson AIOps and create stories and Chatops notifications. We will be looking only at events and Metric Manager interfaces.\n\n  We will start the first exercise by giving you an overview of the generated anomaly.\n\n  Metric Manager performs the analysis without any user configuration.  Once you configured the mediation and started feeding data into Metric Manager, all the algorithm is performed for you automatically.  This allows us to concentrate on the output of these algorithms for these lab exercises. The Metric Manager lab exercise is grouped into Use Cases. \n\n  You will use the Firefox browser to perform the lab exercise. First, make sure you are already in the `VM136_PoC_rh6_9` VM. You can switch to it by clicking on the VMs icon, right-click at the `VM136_PoC_rh6_9` VM, and choose \"Open Link in New Tab\".

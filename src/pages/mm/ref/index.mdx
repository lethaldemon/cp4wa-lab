# Metric Manager Terminology and Concept

  Some of the terminologies and concepts of Metric Manager.

  - __Aggregation Interval__, The aggregation interval is the period by which metric data is grouped to be aggregated. Data is normalized to the same interval so the algorithms can process it. Usually, the aggregation interval needs to be set to the data collection interval or to the smallest common multiple of data collection intervals if several data sources are fed to a single algorithm. Typical values are 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or 1 hour.
  - __Analytics Model__. The analytics model learns behavior and automatically detects trends and behavior of metrics and resources using custom algorithms developed in conjunction with research from the Watson project.
  - __Anomaly vs. Alarm__. An anomaly is when a KPI deviates from its normal behavior. Metric Manager learns, defines, and refines normal behavior during training. An anomaly may be temporary. An alarm is when Metric Manager sees a KPI (or multiple KPIs) have deviated to a level where it is a problem and must be investigated.
  - __Baseline__. A baseline is a guide to display the upper and lower values within which a KPI can appear without it being anomalous. A baseline is learned during training. It is shown in the Watson AIOps Metric Manager UI with a green shaded area.  The baseline is constantly being recalculated. The baseline is defined using the analytics model. The analytics model, once trained, begins retraining immediately. A baseline is created each time we create an analytics model. The first analytics model is, by default, based on four weeks of data. After the first model is created, retraining the Analytics model occurs by defaulting each new day of data.
  We have two different types of baseline. One that changes with the KPI value, which is seasonal. The other remains a flatline even though the KPI values fluctuate, which is non-seasonal.
  - __Causal group__. causal group is the group of related metrics (max of 6) that are deemed to be related to an anomalous KPI. When you launch an alarm, the causal group is displayed in the related metrics tab.
  - __Consolidated alarm__. The consolidated alarm is multiple alarms that can be grouped into one consolidated alarm in the AEL. Each can have a causal group of 6 max, which may lead to many related metrics.
  - __KPI (Key Performance Indicator)__. A KPI in the context of Metric Manager is a combination of a resource and its metrics.
  - __Mediation Model__. The mediation model is the model created using the mediation tool. It is an XML file with a `.pamodel` extension deployed to the Watson AIOps Metric Manager database. It describes to the analytics component the metric groups, metrics, and resources to be extracted and from what data source. These models must be deployed to a topic.
  - __Steady state__. A steady-state occurs when you are loading for the latest interval, which is in near real-time. You are in a steady state if you are loading your latest data close to actual time through mediation and are scoring. Training may happen in a steady state, but it will take until the end of the training period before alarms appear.
  - __Topic__. A topic is a method by which Watson AIOps Metric Manager can separate data logically by geographical location, application, or any other grouping, making sense to the user. 
  - __Training__. Training is the number of weeks (default 2) by which Watson AIOps Metric Manager builds its analytics model and learns the behavior for the metric groups, metrics, and resources defined in the mediation model.
